        <h3>Covered Call Strategy with Stock</h3>
        <p><em>Posted on November 10, 2025</em></p>

        <!-- full original blog content preserved exactly -->
        <p>Let’s assume we hold 100 shares of stock XZY in our portfolio, purchased some time ago at $100 each. Today, the stock is worth $110.
        The cost basis (initial investment) is therefore $10,000 (100 shares × $100), while the current market value is $11,000 (100 shares × $110).
        This gives us an unrealized profit of $1,000 (10%). However, we don’t want to sell XZY yet because we believe it could rise further — up to $115,
        a price at which we’d be satisfied to sell, locking in a 15% gain.</p>

        <p>So, we sell a Call option with a strike price of $115, expiring in one week, for a premium of $1. The buyer of the Call immediately pays $100
        ($1 × 100 contracts) to us.</p>

        <p>What happens at expiration, seven days later? If the price of XZY exceeds the strike price — for example, it rises to $117 — we are
        obligated to sell XZY at $115 to the buyer of the Call. Important note: the buyer is not obligated to exercise the option, but since they hold a
        Call contract that allows them to acquire an asset worth $117 on the market for just $115 (an immediate $2 profit), they will almost certainly
        choose to exercise it.</p>

        <p>The seller (us), in turn, will be satisfied because they achieve exactly what they aimed for: selling XZY with a 15% gain. Of course, the seller
        forgoes $2 compared to selling directly on the market at $117 (since they’re selling at the $115 strike price), but they’ve still reached their
        target profit: $15 per share from capital appreciation (15%) plus the $1 premium from selling the Call (1%), for a total gain of 16%.</p>

        <p>If, instead, the price of the underlying stays below the strike price — say it reaches $114 — nothing happens because the Call expires
        worthless. The buyer loses the $100 paid to the seller, who keeps the amount as profit, earning a 1% return ($100) on their investment, which
        consists of the 100 shares of XZY still held in the portfolio. These shares remain in the portfolio, and the same strategy can be repeated each
        week. Obviously, if our asset drops sharply in price — say, down to $95 — everything previously stated still applies (we still collect the $100),
        but we now have an unrealized loss of $5 per share. However, this has nothing to do with the sale of the Call, which still generated $100 in
        income — money we wouldn’t have earned without that transaction.</p>

        <p>As is clear, this is a way to generate relatively consistent profits, with the “risk” of having to sell the asset to the Call buyer — but still doing so
        at a profit. In other words, there’s no actual risk involved. There are no additional risks because the asset was already part of the portfolio: the
        Call seller wouldn't have acted differently even if the asset’s price had fallen, since exit levels (such as a drop below a certain threshold) or
        other risk management measures — like an evaluation of the asset’s fundamentals (which are considered strong in this case) — had already been taken
        into account.</p>

        <p>This operation can be repeated indefinitely, and that’s exactly what many fund managers do with the assets in their portfolios. It is a widely used
        method for generating cash without making any changes to the underlying holdings.</p>

        <p>Another important aspect: if the stock gets "called away," as they say (meaning it is sold because it has reached or exceeded the strike price),
        that asset is removed from the portfolio. At that point, if you still consider it a good investment, XZY can simply be repurchased — either
        directly on the market or at a discount by selling a Put, as discussed earlier (Short Put-Based Machine).</p>

        <p>The maximum risk is described as "undefined" because, in advance, it cannot be precisely quantified. In the event of a significant drop in the price
        of the underlying stock, the potential loss can be substantial. However, this risk was already inherent in the position held prior to selling the call —
        that is, when the XZY stock was in the portfolio without an associated call.</p>

        <p>The decision to retain this asset in the portfolio was made following a thorough evaluation of the issuer’s solidity and reliability. Any price
        pullbacks were considered temporary and normal market fluctuations. It was also determined that, in such circumstances, there would be no need to
        liquidate the position at a loss, thus keeping the investment strategy unchanged.</p>

        <p>From a strictly mathematical perspective, the maximum risk is not technically infinite, but rather equal to the total loss of the value of the XZY stock —
        i.e., in the event the stock price drops to zero. This is an extremely rare scenario, especially for companies considered solid and fundamentally sound.
        In such an extreme case, the maximum loss would correspond to the entire amount invested in the position, which is $10,000, calculated as 100 shares
        purchased at $100 each.</p>

        <p>Contrary to what is often inaccurately stated, commonly referred “undefined risk” strategies — such as Short Puts, Short Calls, and Covered Calls, among others —
        do not imply technically infinite risk. In every case, there is a theoretical cap on the maximum loss, no matter how large. This cap is based on the fact that
        an asset’s price cannot fall below zero (as with the maximum losses in Short Put and Covered Call strategies), nor can it grow indefinitely in practical terms,
        even though this represents a theoretical risk for the Short Call.</p>

        <p>As shown in the figure below, the P/L chart of the Covered Call...</p>

        <img src="Covered Call 115.png" alt="Covered Call Payoff Chart" class="fade-img">

        <p>Important Note: Use of Available Capital — It is important to note that the Profit/Loss (P/L) charts for the Short Put and Covered Call strategies are
        virtually overlapping. This indicates that, under identical operating parameters, both strategies offer a substantially equivalent risk/reward profile.</p>
